## Surfs Up: Observing Weather Patterns to Assess Business Viability

### Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide a summary of temperature statistics for the island of Oahu during the peak tourism months of June and December. An investor considering whether to invest in our venture - an ice cream and surf shop - requested this information as a means to determine whether there will be sufficient demand for our business during potentially extreme weather months. This analysis should comfort climate-wary investors that there will be ample demand for surfing-related supplies and frozen treats year-round.

### Results
Key differences between Oahu temperatures in June and December are bulleted below - 

* The June average temperature (~75) is around 4 degrees warmer than December's average (~71). This ~4-degree difference is observed at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles as well.
* The degree to which temperature varies is comparable between the months, as the standard deviation is around 3.5 degrees for both months. Generally speaking, this seems low in comparison to other parts of the globe, which may experience more severe shifts in weather.
* Though maximum and minimum temperatures are by nature somewhat of an outlier measure, it is notable that December's minimum (56) is nearly 10 degrees lower than June's (64).

### Summary
An anaysis of June and December temperature data in Oahu show that temperatures tend to hover around the low-to-mid 70's during these two months. The variation of temperatures is limited, as the standard deviation for both months is under 4 degrees. Additional climate-related queries to determine the sustainability of the surf-and-ice cream shop may include:

* <b>Precipitation</b>: Rainfall may greatly affect surfer activity, and should be considered a key variable for consideration. If December or June are heavy precipitation months, it may deter surfers and potential diners, regardless of temperature.
* <b>Fall and Spring</b>: Consider querying temperature data for the Fall and Spring equinox months, as this may (similarly) reveal highs, lows, averages, and/or other trends that help investors assess the feasibility of a year-round business model for this venture.
